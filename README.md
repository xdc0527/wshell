# wshell
Wsh (short for Wisconsin Shell) is a custom Unix-like shell implemented in C. It supports essential features of modern shells, including command parsing, execution, job control, I/O redirection, and piping. The project was developed as part of an operating systems course to deepen my understanding of process management, signals, and system calls.
